Welcome to Duel
===============
This game should remind the players a bit of the glorious old days of door games in the BBS systems. Personally I prefer some of the text based games, such as LORD, over some of the fancy Flash that people play these days. Anyway, this is written in Rails so I can get it up and running QUICKLY. In this game, I am purposely NOT going to be using a secondary backend server until I feel confident that people are interested in such a feature... My intention is to someday create a game client screen with the likes of HTML 5 Canvas tag and websockets. 

This is all in flux right now. So anything can happen :)
